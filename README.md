### Data

I use the time series data provided by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at the Johns Hopkins University. [It has got daily sampling frequency and it is presented in tabular format](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData).

Remember that the true number of cases is probably multiple times higher than the number of confirmed cases. For an extreme example, on the 27th March, Scotland’s Chief Medical Officer Catherine Calderwood [estimated that more than 65,000 people in Scotland had the virus](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-52058788) when confirmed cases stood at 1059.

### Program files

I release the Python&nbsp;3 software that I write to conduct my analyses under the MIT license for anybody to download.

### Requirements

The following Python&nbsp;3 packages are required. The version numbers are what I have got installed but they are not strict requirements. `beautifulsoup4` is used to parse Wikipedia tables for Germany (Deutschland.md).

`python3==3.7.6`  
`matplotlib==3.0.3`  
`numpy==1.16.4`  
`pandas==0.25.3`  
`scikit-learn==0.21.3`  
`beautifulsoup4==4.8.2`
