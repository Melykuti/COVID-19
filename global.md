## Analysis of the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus

13 March 2020 (updated on 23 April 2020), Freiburg i. Br., Germany, where a lockdown has been in force since 21 March 2020. -- The WHO releases [daily situation reports](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports) with the numbers of diagnosed COVID-19 cases for each country. We can see the total number of confirmed cases and the total deaths since the beginning of the outbreak. We also get the changes from the last report, that is, these two figures for the last day only.

Thinking in terms of the classical SIR model of epidemiology, the population comprises three groups: **S**usceptibles, **I**nfected and **R**emoved. _Removed_ are those who have recovered from or died of the disease and thereby are no longer infectious and can no longer catch the disease. _Infected_ are the current patients who are also all infectious. _Susceptibles_ are everybody else: people who have not been infected yet (and hopefully will never be).

In the initial stage of an epidemic, we expect that most contacts by infected people will be with a susceptible person. This provides a fertile ground for the disease to spread. The number of infected people is rising exponentially (in the mathematical, not in the vague and overused marketing sense) until there are so many of them that it is becoming harder for the disease to find susceptibles.

**Unfortunately, most countries saw exponential growth of case numbers without introducing lockdowns. (As far as I know, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan are a few which have avoided this.) With lockdowns in force for three weeks now, a deceleration of growth is seen in Italy, Spain, Germany, France.**

Exponential growth means that from one day to the next, the total number of infected people increases not by a fixed number but by a fixed multiple. In any one hospital, the number of new patients per day is not the same as the number of new patients was yesterday. Instead, it is increasing by the same factor every day. For example, today the hospital gets 11 new patients, tomorrow 13, the day after 16, on day&nbsp;4 already 19, on day&nbsp;5 23. If the stream doesn't stop, then on day&nbsp;10 it will be 57 new patients, and so on. Each patient spends one to three weeks hospitalised, and the people being removed from the hospital are the lower numbers that arrived one to three weeks ago. If you are medical personnel and had a hard day at work, you can be sure that tomorrow will be even harder, the day after still harder. There is no system capable of meeting this demand.

**Our intuition is also caught off guard. The risk of contracting the disease is not constant; it is increasing by the same factor every day. It's silently, imperceptibly creeping up until the disease is everywhere around us unless we stop it.**

### How shall I think about the danger which I'm exposed to?...

_What is the probability of coming into contact with the disease if I leave my home?_ While I cannot answer that, a good proxy is the number of currently infected people.

Some of the infected people will be in hospital, some at home, but some will be around us on the streets, in the grocery shops, on public transport. I assume that the ratio between infected people in isolation (in hospital or at their home) and those among us is independent of how many people are infected in total. With the growth of the infected population, the count of infected people on the street and in grocery shops grows proportionally (unless social distancing takes hold or a lockdown is introduced and people start avoiding public spaces).

**From day to day, your chance of encountering an infected person on the street is growing by a fixed factor as long as the disease is spreading exponentially (and people don't vanish from the streets). The daily growth rate of cases across several countries was about 15-30% without extreme control measures, such as a lockdown.**


### Data

The Center for Systems Science and Engineering at the Johns Hopkins University is kindly providing [the time series data with daily sampling frequency in tabular format](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData).

Remember that the true number of cases is probably multiple times higher than the number of confirmed cases. For an extreme example, on the 27th March, Scotlandâ€™s Chief Medical Officer Catherine Calderwood [estimated that more than 65,000 people in Scotland had the virus](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-52058788) when confirmed cases stood at 1059.

### Program files

* **download_JHU_CSSE.py** is a script to download three csv data tables: the number of confirmed cases, the number of deaths due to the disease, and the number of recovered patients, broken down to countries. The script automatically inserts the timestamp of download into the file names so that later downloads do not overwrite downloaded data.

* **utils.py** contains the universal data selection, preprocessing, analysis and plotting functionalities. It searches for the most recent download of `download_JHU_CSSE.py` in the current directory based on the timestamp in the file name. If you want to select a particular one, then modify the variable `timestamp` in `open_csvs()`.

* **analysis_single.py** runs the analysis and plots or saves a graph for a single country.

* **analysis_joint.py** calls the analysis and optionally saves plots repeatedly on a list of countries.

### Analysis

I compute the number of currently infectious people as the number of total confirmed cases minus the number of deaths minus the number of recovered patients for all days where there is data:

`no. of currently infected = no. of cases - no. of deaths - no. of recovered.`

(On 24 March 2020, I reported the total number of confirmed cases for each country because the number of recoveries was not included in the JHU CSSE dataset.)

#### Exponential growth model

Originally, my analysis was founded on the assumption that the growth of this number is exponential. In this case, I take the base&nbsp;2 logarithm of this time series for a selected country, and fit a straight line to the last 4-14 days of data with _ordinary least squares (OLS)_. If the growth is exponential or thereabouts, then this should fit quite well and the slope of this line will tell us the growth rate. The length of this time window is optimised to provide the best linear fit.

From this slope I compute:

1. The growth factor per day, which I express in percentage terms. (What percentage more infectious people we expect tomorrow than we had today.)

2. How many days it takes for the number of infectious people to double.

3. I make a crude estimate of what I guess the total number of infected people might currently be.

The third one is only my guesswork. The idea is that in the case of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, it takes on average 5-6 days to develop symptoms (fever, a usually dry cough and others). This incubation time varies between 1 to 14 days. The people who were infected today will present symptoms and will be tested perhaps 4-6 days from now. They will enter the figure in the situation report only thereafter. Also, they are likely to be already infectious sooner than that and that is what worries us as common people.

So I project from my linear regression the number of infected four, respectively, six days from the latest data point, and that is the estimate for the current total case number. This is probably too conservative and may be a low estimate not only because many cases never get tested and recorded but also because from developing symptoms, one still needs perhaps 1-3 days to get tested and for the test result to enter the international statistical tables. There are also wide differences between how much testing different countries do; low testing intensity is bound to bias the confirmed case number downwards.

The exponential curve is not always a good fit (a straight line is not always a good fit to the logarithm of the current case number). Especially after the introduction of draconian countermeasures, such as a lockdown, the growth slowed substantially.

#### Linear growth model

As long as I was fitting exponential models, the interpretation could only be that growth was exponential. Towards the end of March and beginning of April, this no longer held for many countries. Once the daily new case number starts to stabilise, it is natural to fit a linear model. The procedure is the same but I fit to the case numbers and not to their logarithms.

The first dataset is the 30 March 2020 where I tried fitting linear models in addition to the exponentials as well. I had originally presented exponential fits exclusively. Upon the switchover to the new methodology, I also show the fits where I selected the best of exponential and linear fits for comparison. The last column in the table now displays `e` for the case when the exponential model is a better fit, `l` when the linear model.

The _doubling time_ is by nature a notion best suited for exponential growth. I compute it for linear growth, too, although it is less meaningful. In exponential growth, after twice the doubling time, there will be four times the original case number. After `n` times the doubling time, you have got `2^n` times the original count. In linear growth, after twice the doubling time, you have got only three times the original count. After `n` times the doubling time, you have got `n+1` times the original count.

The next columns of the table are used to compare the two models and to compare different window lengths:

4. The [R^2 or coefficient of determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination) of the linear regression fit (which I can't explain here). The closer it is to 1, the better the match is between the data and my linear regression. This is straightforward for both the exponential and the linear models, it is just so that for the exponential model, the linear fit happens for the logarithm of the time series.

5. I also compute the difference between the value of the fitted straight line for the last day when we have data and the real observation _in the logarithmic space_ for that last day.  
For the _exponential model_, this is indeed a difference. You can interpret this number as a ratio between the linear approximation and the data because it is a difference between the logarithms. For the _linear model_, this is the ratio of the fitted line on the last available day and the real observation for the last available day, minus 1.  
If the spread is slowing relative to the exponential rate, then this number will be great and the projection is definitely unreliable. If this difference is small, then the projection might well be good. When the difference is negative, then the projection will be an underestimate of the true case number!

The automatic selection of the window length minimises the l_2 norm of the two-dimensional vector  
`(10 * (1-R^2), difference between projection and last data point in base 2 logarithmic space).`  
So I minimise both 1-R^2 and the difference between the fitted line and the true data point (only for the most recent date). The factor of 10 is there to weigh one relative to the other. Note that the difference is in log2 space so it is a factor in linear space. So R^2=0.99 gives first coordinate 10*0.01 = 0.1, and to get the same second coordinate of 0.1, you'd have a ratio of 2^0.1 = 1.072 between linear fit and actual data for the last available data point. This is how the two errors trade off in my window length selection.

To choose between the exponential and the linear models, once I have selected the optimal window size independently for each, I choose the model where this l_2 norm is smaller.

Even when the daily increments have stabilised and the growth is clearly only linear, it can happen that both the exponential and the linear models fit well in the time window and the optimisation selects the exponential as the slightly better one. Therefore one should not attribute too much importance to preference for the exponential model over the linear one.

I show projections for the number of infected 4-to-6 days from now (which, as I said, is what I guess to be the real number of cumulative coronavirus cases today) only if (the R^2 is greater than or equal to 0.95 and the above difference is not greater than 0.5) or if the difference is in [-0,2;&nbsp; 0,1]. Since 15 April 2020, I have omitted the projections also when active case numbers are decreasing.

### Plots

The plots for each individual country present the observed total number of infected on the left panel, and the same data on logarithmic scale on the right panel. These lines are in blue.

If the exponential model fits better, then orange is the fit of the exponential curve, which is the same as the fit of a straight line on logarithmic scale (on the right panel). If the linear model fits better, then pink is the linear fit, which is the same as the fit of a straight line on natural scale (on the left panel).

* Time it takes for the number of currently infected people to double

* Latest reported total number of currently infected cases

* (Since 30 March 2020) Latest reported total number of currently infected cases per 100,000 population

* My estimate for total number of currently infected cases at present. (Since 30 March 2020, per 100,000 population. I describe at the end of the Analysis why it is missing in certain cases.)

* R^2 of linear regression fit

* Difference between linear fit and real data in logarithmic space for the last data point

* (Since 18 March 2020) The number of days in the time window in which I fit the linear regression. It is automatically optimised to minimise the vector (10 * (1-R^2), difference) in l_2.

* (Since 11 April 2020) e if the exponential model, l if the linear model provides the better fit and yielded the entries in the specific row of the table.

I focus on countries with a large number of cases and on those to which I have got some personal connection. China and South Korea are examples where the preventative measures have slowed down the epidemic spread massively.
